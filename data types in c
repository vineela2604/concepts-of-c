A programming language is proposed to help programmer to process certain kinds of data and to
provide useful output.The task of data processing is accomplished by executing series of commands
called program.
              A program usually contains different types of data types (integer, float, character
etc.) and need to store the values being used in the program. C language is rich of data types. A C
programmer has to employ proper data type as per his requirements.


C has different data types for different types of data and can be broadly classified as:

1. Primary Data Types
2. Secondary Data Types
